## Chapter 1 Algorithm Basics
Before you jump into the study of `algorithms`, you need a little background. To
begin with, you need to know that, simply stated, an algorithm is a `recipe for getting something done`. It defines the steps for performing a task in a certain way.
That definition seems simple enough, but no one writes algorithms for
performing extremely simple tasks. No one writes instructions for how to
access the fourth element in an array. It is just assumed that this is part of the
definition of an array and that you know how to do it (if you know how to use
the programming language in question).
Normally, people write algorithms only for `difficult` tasks. Algorithms explain
how to find the `solution` to a complicated algebra problem, how to find the shortest path through a `network` containing thousands of streets, or how to find the
best mix of hundreds of investments to optimize profits.
This chapter explains some of the basic algorithmic concepts you should
understand if you want to get the most out of your study of algorithms.
It may be tempting to skip this chapter and jump to studying specific algorithms, but you should at least skim this material. Pay close attention to the section “Big O Notation,” because a good understanding of run time performance
can mean the difference between an algorithm performing its task in seconds,
hours, or not at all.
